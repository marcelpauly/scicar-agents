    "# Extract data from images\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to extract data from some [voter flow charts](https://www.tagesschau.de/wahl/archiv/2025-02-23-BT-DE/analyse-wanderung.shtml). Each chart shows, for one party at the center, how many voters it gained from or lost to other parties compared to the previous election. Traditional OCR won’t get us very far (or would require a great deal of effort). LLMs, however, can recognize elements such as parties, arrows, directions, and labeled numbers as parts of a coherent diagram, especially if we describe how the chart is structured. This allows the LLM to translate the graphic into structured data."
